                I'm a 30 year old chilean developer with a past of a business
                and administration degree.

                I switched careers because the
                <strong>immersion that coding brings </strong> to my daily life.
                While I work I like to listen to some music that I think fits
                the feeling of the day.

                I came to Australia with my wife for the typical work and
                holiday experience, work and travel. We would love to stay in
                Australia for many reasons:

              <ul>
                <li>Everyone is really nice.</li>
                <li>Work life balance is unbeatable.</li>

              <p>My main hobbies are playing the guitar and sports.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Music for me is one of the corner stones of my life. My
                  brother showed me the world of funk, rock and metal which made
                  me interested in learning to play the guitar.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Sports are like therapy to me. I enjoy mainly 3 sports:
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Yoga: It's a daily routine that sets me up for success.
                      Giving the day an intention makes me much more probability
                      of achieving what I want to achieve.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Football / Soccer: Playing with a team it's game changer
                      to me. Gets me in the zone like no other experience.
                      Feeling the connection between the one that delivers and
                      the one that receives the ball is other worldly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Climbing: I used to do wall climbing for most of my
                      university years. It had such a great energy. Sharing
                      personal success with friends present. I quit though
                      because I had a near death experience which made me
                      realize that it is too risky for me.
